## Task 1: Recreate

Recreate the following plot (Source: <https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/doctor-who-suffers-lowest-ratings-since-2005-revival-39028919.html>).

Improve the plot above.

## Task 3: Doctors and seasons

In the revived era there have been five doctors, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_episodes_(2005%E2%80%93present)#Regular_seasons) for which doctors were in which seasons. Recreate the previous visualization, this time including doctor information.

```{r doctors}
doctors <- tribble(
  ~season_number, ~doctor_no, ~doctor_name,
               1,          9, "Christopher Eccleston",
               2,         10, "David Tennant",
               3,         10, "David Tennant",
               4,         10, "David Tennant",

## Summary

In this coding session we created 3 visualizations, each of which a slightly modified or customized. The first visualization uses geom_col to visualize how viewership of Dr.Who changes over the years. I reordered this so that the two axis would be switched. The next visualization was an improvement of the initial visualization; we chose to do a scatter plot on top of a line graph to demonstrate the changing viewership. I decided to remove the grid lines as it was distracting me from the data. The last visualization uses left_join and mutates existing datasets to include the different actors that have played doctors. Thus, in the visualization the different shapes represent the different doctors that played Dr.Who. This allows for more investigation about whether the actor influences viewership.
